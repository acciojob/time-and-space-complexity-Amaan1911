	   <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms aim to have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution for larger inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run, including input storage, auxiliary storage, and call stack memory. It is commonly expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which represents linear space growth concerning input size.</p>
